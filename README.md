# Module-1
- This this Horiseon Website that I was assigned to look over and edit.
The changes I did were the following: 
- I changed the title to fit the name of the company. 
- I also changed the DIV in the header to a NAV for semantic reasons. 
- I also added and alt= to the end of the images to make it more accessible. 
- And added an id= because one of the links were not working. 
- Also changed more DIV to SECTION and ASIDE for semantic purposes as well. 
- And the last thing was I changed the DIV in the footer to FOOTER and changed the H2 in the footer to a H4 because I felt it wasn't as important as the H2 and H3.
