# Module-1
The changes I did were the following, I changed the title to fit the name of the company. I also changed the <div> in the header to a <nav> for semantic reasons. I also added and alt= to the end of the images to make it more accessible. And added an id= because one of the links were not working. Also changed more <div> to <section> and <aside> for semantic purposes as well. And the last thing was I changed the <div> in the footer to <footer> and changed the <h2> in the footer to a <h4> because I felt it wasn't as important as the <h2> and <h3>.
